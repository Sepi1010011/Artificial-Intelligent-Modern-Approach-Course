in this folder we have codes of some Algorithms that can use in simple environment and initialize with initial state to reach goal state 
we have two types of Search in this env:
1- Uninformed Search: It just consider the distance of two states(g(n)) like BFS, DFS.
2- Informed Search: Besides of distance of two states(g(n)) it will consider distance of that state from it's goal state (h(n)) like A* or Gready best-first search that just take (h(n)) not (g(n)).
